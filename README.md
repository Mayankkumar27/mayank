The Collection Framework in Java is a structured architecture in the java.util package that provides a set of interfaces and classes for handling and manipulating groups of objects efficiently. It includes interfaces like List (ordered, allows duplicates, e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList), Set (unordered, no duplicates, e.g., HashSet, TreeSet), Queue (FIFO-based, e.g., PriorityQueue), and Map (key-value pairs, e.g., HashMap, TreeMap). These interfaces are implemented by concrete classes, offering various data structures and algorithms for better performance and flexibility.
